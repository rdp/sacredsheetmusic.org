  # 10 days worth basically I think always over 20M each day...
  rotate 10
  # NB rotate 0 isn't enough, it causes the current processes to keep logging to the old dead file, but at least it protects the filesystem [?] or did it keep logging but, reset the file down to nothing? all bad...so manually restart here
  create 0660 rdp rdp
  postrotate
     sudo -u rdp /home/rdp/prod_flds/restart.sh # spits out error messages but works OK...
  endscript

# huh?
