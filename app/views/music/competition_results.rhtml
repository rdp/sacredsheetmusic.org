These are the current results, competition isn't over yet though!  Remember the first purpose of the competition is to get feedback and learn how to be a better composer/author :)

  We recently finished our yearly sheet music competition (for composers to get feedback) with some awesome entries. 
<br/>Competition this year is sponsored by <a href=https://visitkanab.org/accommodation/tranquility-trails/>Tranquility Trails</a>, a place to stay in the heart of utah's national parks and Lake Powell.
<br/>And without further ado, the winners of this year's Sacred Sheet Music Competition are (drum roll, please):
<br/>

<div style="width:50%; float:left;">
First the "open vote" category:
<br/>
<br/>
<% for p in @products %>
  <%= p.total_valid_competition_points %> points: <%= link_to(p.name, :controller=>'music', :action=>'show', :id => p.code) %> by <%= p.composer_tag.name %>
<div class="clear"></div>
<%= p.thumbnail_html_cache %>
<div class="clear"></div>
<% end %>

</div>

<div style="width:50%; float:left;">
And our peer review category winners (out of possible 5.0):
<br/>
<br/>
<% for p in @peer_review_products %>
  <%= "%.02f" % p.competition_peer_review_average %> : <%= link_to(p.name, :controller=>'music', :action=>'show', :id => p.code) %> by <%= p.composer_tag.name %>
  <div class="clear"></div>
<%= p.thumbnail_html_cache %>
<div class="clear"></div>
